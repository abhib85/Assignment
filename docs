Folders:

client folder : incoming excel sheets
network location : merged excel files updated from the client folder
config file : storing all paths
log : logging

use class
import module-pandas, logging,configparser,
call config elements
use function

merge all the files
then put  merge file to one location...network location
if file are not available in client location ..handle exception

after merge  print merge successful
end .. process completed
